# Algorithms implemented in Kotlin

This repository contains several algorithms that were implemented as part of reading through the [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262033844) book, as part of going through MIT's [Open Courseware SMA 5503](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/index.htm) materials.

The choice of using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) as the implementation language was based on personal curiosity and background with [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Java](https://go.java).
